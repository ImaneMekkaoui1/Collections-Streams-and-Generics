##  Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of **Java Collections (List, Map, Set), Streams, Lambda expressions, and Generics** through several hands-on exercises.  
The goal is to understand **how to store, manage, and manipulate objects** using Java OOP concepts and **generic programming**.

The exercises are divided into **two main parts**:

1. **Collections & Streams**
2. **Generics and OOP with a Product Management Application**
